This project uses HTML and CSS to create the Google homepage. It is a non-functional, non-exact replica that provided me the opportunity to reduce my reliance on Bootstrap to style pages.
That, in turn, allowed me to practice looking up how to implement features using base CSS, particularly navbars, and to practice inspecting page elements in the browser console as needed for reference (e.g. to determine a specific font used or obtain the color of a specific element).
